# Fixed Code:
```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    """Returns the sum of two numbers."""
    return a + b  # Added 'return' statement

def greet(name):
    """Prints a greeting message."""
    print("Hello, " + name)  # Added colon in function definition

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:  # Corrected loop variable usage
    print(num)  # Corrected indentation error

print(add_numbers(5, 3))
greet("hallema")
```
